# Buffer
`/dev/null` but not really, built to be compatible, inspired by networking hatred.

### Why?
Because the majority of players want some kind of device they can use to store massive amounts of items, auto-collect and auto-void them, and place down for temporary extraction. It's handy, really.

### How?
Buffer was written with [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/) (& API), using [LibGUI](https://github.com/CottonMC/LibGui) and [NBT Crafting](https://github.com/Siphalor/nbt-crafting). It's meant to be simple and elegant whenever possible.

### License?
Not `:arr:`!
Buffer is released under [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html), because whenever possible, software should be made available to others. Much of Buffer's development was heavily helped by community members.

### Style? Guidelines?
Buffer is now moving towards using the [Google Style for Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), which sets reasonable standards for code readability, albeit it has opted to use spaces instead of tabs, and section 4.6.1-1 is not obligatory if method names are similar or the same.
